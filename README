These packages will provide a tool for CLs calculations.  Use
cls_analysis.py (see its documentation) to run the code.

Overview of files:
cls_analysis.py: Runs everything.  Has optional flags for input.

StandardHypoTestInvDemo.C: Performs the actual calculations.  Needs a 
  specially formatted workspace passed to it.

workspace_preparer.C: Prepares this specially formatted workspace.  Uses
  input histograms as the signal / background / data.

config_reader.C: Helps the workspace_preparer.C read values from a config
  file that contains physical specifications of the model.

config file: contains declarations of variables such as luminosity, etc.

Other files: The uneven_*.root files contain sample data that the code
  will run on.  The counting.cfg file is currently set up for this data.
  The run.sh file shows how the sample code can be run.
